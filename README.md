# FMFCC-A
This project is the description of FMFCC-A (audio track of FMFCC) dataset and Challenge resluts.

The FMFCC-A dataset are shared through BaiduCloud (website: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1CGPkC8VfjXVBZjluEHsW6g , password: IIES). In addition, official website of FMFCC-A (Audio track of the first fake media forensic challenge of China Society of Image and Graphics) :  http://fmfcc.net/ . We hope that the FMFCC-A dataset can fill the gap of lack of Mandarin datasets for synthetic speech detection.
